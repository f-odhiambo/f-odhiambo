<h1>Hi, I'm Francis 👋</h1>

I’m a Senior Technical Program Manager who builds and scales complex data and AI-enabled platforms — from early architecture through multi-country production rollouts supporting 1M+ users.

My work sits at the intersection of **engineering execution, systems architecture, and stakeholder alignment**. I specialize in turning ambiguous problem spaces into executable technical programs, especially where data platforms, interoperability, and AI/ML are involved.

Most of what I do is practical and outcome-driven: clear roadmaps, strong technical alignment, and delivery mechanisms that work in real-world constraints.

<h2>What I work on</h2>

- **Large-scale technical programs**  
  Cross-org initiatives spanning backend services, APIs, data pipelines, and AI-enabled workflows

- **AI & data platforms (execution-focused)**  
  AI/ML integration, speech-to-text pipelines, decision-support systems, analytics platforms

- **Interoperability & platform foundations**  
  API programs, FHIR-based systems, data standards, and system-to-system integration at scale

- **Program execution under ambiguity**  
  Dependency mapping, risk management, roadmap sequencing, and delivery governance across distributed teams

- **Modernization & scalability**  
  Migrating legacy architectures to scalable, cloud-based platforms with measurable performance improvements

<h2>About me</h2>

- **Senior Technical Program Manager** with 10+ years of experience spanning software engineering, technical leadership, and large-scale program delivery

- Led multi-quarter platform initiatives across **digital health, fintech, and public-sector systems**, including deployments across 6+ countries

- Former **Technical Program Manager II at Ona**, where I reduced rework by 70%, modernized data architectures, and introduced AI-enabled components into production systems

- Background in software engineering, which allows me to partner deeply with engineers while maintaining a systems-level view of execution, risk, and outcomes

- Currently focused on **Senior / Principal TPM roles** working on distributed systems, platform foundations, and AI-enabled infrastructure

<h2>Currently exploring</h2>

- AI-enabled platform patterns (agent-assisted workflows, decision systems)
- Scalable data architectures and observability for complex programs
- How TPMs can better drive delivery for AI and platform teams
- Program execution models for high-ambiguity technical environments
