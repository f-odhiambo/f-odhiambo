<h1>Hi, I’m Francis 👋</h1>

I’m a Senior Technical Product Manager, building and scaling complex data and AI-enabled platforms — from early product definition and architecture through multi-country production rollouts supporting 1M+ users.

My work sits at the intersection of product strategy, engineering execution, and systems architecture. I specialize in turning ambiguous, high-stakes problem spaces into clear product and technical direction, then driving those initiatives through delivery — especially where data platforms, interoperability, and AI/ML are involved.

Most of what I do is practical and outcome-driven: shaping product direction when requirements are unclear, aligning engineers around workable designs, and ensuring delivery mechanisms succeed under real-world constraints.

<h2>What I work on</h2>

- <strong>Ambiguous product & platform initiatives</strong><br />
  Defining product direction, scope, and execution plans for complex platform and data products where requirements are unclear and constraints are real

- <strong>Platform products at scale</strong><br />
  Owning end-to-end delivery of platform capabilities spanning backend services, APIs, data pipelines, and AI-enabled workflows across distributed teams

- <strong>AI & data platforms (product-to-production)</strong><br />
  Driving AI/ML-enabled features from concept through production, including speech-to-text pipelines, decision-support systems, analytics platforms, and applied ML workflows

- <strong>Interoperability & platform foundations</strong><br />
  Owning API products, FHIR-based systems, data standards, and system-to-system integrations that enable new products and national-scale adoption

- <strong>Execution under ambiguity</strong><br />
  Translating product intent into executable plans through dependency mapping, risk management, roadmap sequencing, and delivery governance

- <strong>Modernization & scalability</strong><br />
  Leading product and platform modernization efforts from legacy architectures to scalable, cloud-native systems with measurable improvements in performance, reliability, and cost efficiency
