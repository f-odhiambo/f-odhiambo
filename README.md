<h1>Hi, I’m Francis 👋</h1>

I’m a Senior Technical Program Manager with a strong product mindset, building and scaling complex data and AI-enabled platforms — from early architecture and product definition through multi-country production rollouts supporting 1M+ users.

My work sits at the intersection of product intent, engineering execution, and systems architecture. I specialize in turning ambiguous, high-stakes problem spaces into clear technical and product direction, then driving those initiatives through delivery — especially where data platforms, interoperability, and AI/ML are involved.

Most of what I do is practical and outcome-driven: shaping direction when requirements are unclear, aligning engineers around workable designs, and building delivery mechanisms that succeed under real-world constraints.

<h2>What I work on</h2>

- <strong>Ambiguous product & platform initiatives</strong><br />
  Defining direction, scope, and execution plans for complex platform and data products where requirements are unclear and constraints are real

- <strong>Large-scale technical programs</strong><br />
  Owning and leading cross-org initiatives spanning backend services, APIs, data pipelines, and AI-enabled workflows across distributed teams

- <strong>AI & data platforms (product-to-production)</strong><br />
  Driving AI/ML integration from concept through production, including speech-to-text pipelines, decision-support systems, analytics platforms, and applied ML workflows

- <strong>Interoperability & platform foundations</strong><br />
  Owning API programs, FHIR-based systems, data standards, and system-to-system integrations that enable new products and national-scale adoption

- <strong>Program execution under ambiguity</strong><br />
  Dependency mapping, risk management, roadmap sequencing, and delivery governance in high-uncertainty technical environments

- <strong>Modernization & scalability</strong><br />
  Leading migrations from legacy architectures to scalable, cloud-native platforms with measurable improvements in performance, reliability, and cost efficiency

<h2>About me</h2>

- <strong>Senior Technical Program Manager / Product-oriented TPM</strong> with 10+ years of experience spanning software engineering, product definition, and large-scale technical delivery

- Led multi-quarter platform initiatives across <strong>digital health, fintech, and public-sector systems</strong>, including deployments across 6+ countries and platforms serving over 1M users

- Former <strong>Technical Program Manager II at Ona</strong>, where I reduced rework by 70%, modernized data architectures, and introduced AI-enabled components into production systems supporting global deployments

- Regularly own platform roadmaps, feature sequencing, and technical trade-offs in close partnership with product, engineering, policy, and regulatory stakeholders

- Background in software engineering, allowing me to partner deeply with engineers while maintaining a systems-level view of execution, risk, and outcomes

- Currently focused on <strong>Senior / Principal TPM and Technical Product Platform roles</strong> working on distributed systems, data platforms, and AI-enabled infrastructure
